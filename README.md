## FAQ

#### What happened to this project?

The full project that I worked on over the summer is in this Org [here](https://github.com/Pilotcity-2021).
The plan is that in future summers, other interns can pick up the project to work on it (improving city engagement is an ever evolving issue)
#### What is it built with? How can I run it?

Unfortunately, I had to remove API keys to protect information, so it will be hard to run. There is a docker compose file, and the java spring server is fairly easy to get around. If you have real interest in running the project, or want to use the Legistar Scraper, email me at alexandermehta@outlook.com. I am open to help and want to help as much as time permits.
